Most of the financial functions (PMT, NPER, IPMT, PPMT, RATE, PV) Function class methods) have been originally copied from the Apache POI project (Apache Software Foundation) . 
They have been then modified and adapted so that they are integrated with UCanAccess, in a consistent manner.

A later fix from the jackcess trunk to the 2.0.5 release  has been included in this distribution. 
It's limited to the class LongValueColumnImpl.
