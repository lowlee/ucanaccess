Most of the financial functions (PMT, NPER, IPMT, PPMT, RATE, PV) Function class methods) have been originally copied from the Apache POI project (Apache Software Foundation) . 
They have been then modified and adapted so that they are integrated with UCanAccess, in a consistent manner.

A later fix to the jackcess 2.0.5 release from the jackcess trunk, limited to the source file http://svn.code.sf.net/p/jackcess/code/jackcess/trunk/src/main/java/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/impl/LongValueColumnImpl.java?p=884, 
has been included in the ucanaccess 2.0.9.1 distribution.
